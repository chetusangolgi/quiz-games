# Design Document

## Overview

The quiz timer GIF feature replaces the existing dot-based timer with an animated GIF that runs for exactly 2 minutes. This provides a more engaging visual experience while maintaining accurate timing functionality.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
TimerComponent
├── GIF Display Container
├── Timer Logic (2-minute countdown)
├── Animation State Management
└── Completion Handler
```

### Timer Flow
1. Timer initialization with 2-minute duration
2. GIF animation starts immediately
3. Internal countdown tracks remaining time
4. GIF stops when timer reaches zero
5. Completion callback triggers next action

## Components and Interfaces

### TimerGif Component
```typescript
interface TimerGifProps {
  onComplete: () => void;
  gifUrl: string;
  duration?: number; // defaults to 120 seconds
  autoStart?: boolean; // defaults to true
}

interface TimerState {
  isActive: boolean;
  timeRemaining: number;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}
```

### Key Methods
- `startTimer()`: Initiates the 2-minute countdown
- `stopTimer()`: Stops the timer and GIF
- `resetTimer()`: Resets to initial state
- `handleComplete()`: Executes completion callback

## Data Models

### Timer Configuration
```typescript
interface TimerConfig {
  duration: number; // 120 seconds
  gifUrl: string;
  autoStart: boolean;
}
```

### Timer Status
```typescript
interface TimerStatus {
  isRunning: boolean;
  timeElapsed: number;
  timeRemaining: number;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}
```

## Error Handling

### GIF Loading Errors
- Fallback to loading spinner if GIF fails to load
- Retry mechanism for network issues
- Error logging for debugging

### Timer Accuracy
- Use `setInterval` with 100ms precision for smooth updates
- Clear intervals on component unmount
- Handle browser tab visibility changes

### Edge Cases
- Component unmounting during active timer
- Multiple timer instances
- Browser performance throttling

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Timer countdown accuracy
- GIF loading and display
- Completion callback execution
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Timer integration with quiz flow
- GIF animation during timer execution
- Responsive behavior across devices

### Performance Tests
- GIF loading performance
- Timer accuracy under load
- Memory usage during long sessions

## Implementation Notes

### GIF Selection
- Use optimized GIF files for web performance
- Consider file size vs. animation quality
- Ensure GIF loops seamlessly during 2-minute duration

### Browser Compatibility
- Test across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Handle different GIF rendering behaviors
- Fallback for browsers with limited GIF support

### Accessibility
- Provide alternative text for screen readers
- Consider motion sensitivity preferences
- Ensure timer completion is announced to assistive technologies
